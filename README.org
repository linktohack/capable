* Limitations
  - Remote access must be enable (for HTTPS to work)
  - Builtin subtitles are not supported
  - Audio channel selection is also not supported

* Risk?
  - The API & player itself are running in your browser
  - Subtitles are proxied through https://vtt.linktohack.com *carrying
    your access token*. The source code of =vtt= can be found here
